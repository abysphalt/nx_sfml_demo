# nx_sfml_demo
simple demo running SFML on nintendo switch


Usage
a working devktipro with SFML from https://github.com/TomBebb/SFML-switch

simply run make and the makefile will compile it for Nintendo switch.

if you want to test on a PC, you need to have SFML installed.

at the moment all the switch related stuff is disabled so further testing can be done on PC.

to build the demo:

make -f Makefile.pc
